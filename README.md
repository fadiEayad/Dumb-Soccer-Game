# Dumb-Soccer-Game
This is a soccer game that I did in high school. It is really dumb, but it made my friends laugh when I showed it to them so that is good enough.
This game is based on the UCL 2017 final between Juventus and Real Madrid when Real Madrid beat Juventus 4-1. Initially, I wanted to make this a proper game, but I did not have the time to do that, and now I have other things to worry about. Nonetheless, I enjoyed making this game in highschool.
